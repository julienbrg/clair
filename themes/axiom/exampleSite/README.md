## Local Dev

To develop `content` locally, just run the normal `hugo` command. A `package.json` file is provided which has three `npm scripts` pre-configured for this purpose.

```shell
# dev build and server with watch
npm run srv
# dev build only
npm run dev
# prd build only
npm run prd
```

To develop the `theme` `css` or `js` see the `README` for the theme itself. To develop the optional _custom_ `css` and/or `js` you will need to configure your own build process. Examples can be found in the theme README.
